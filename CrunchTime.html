                <p>
                    Crunch Time! Beat the Clock is the first game I ever released to Steam. Since then it has garnered over 21,400 acquisitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developed for PC, Crunch Time! was developed for the experimentation section of my University dissertation, wherein I researched the current state of independent game development and the implications that current trends may have on the industry.
                    It was my first time using Unreal Engine (beyond creating singular mechanics) as choosing an engine I was less familiar with provided a stronger "baseline" for what a beginner may experience when attempting game development for the first time.
                    It consists of 5 levels, Cutscenes, 2 "Boss Fights" and a tutorial level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was developed with Unreal Engine 5.1 within the span of 3 months (though 95% of development took place within a single month), all assets were created by myself (barring sounds and animations) and the game was released in March of 2023. Since releasing it Unreal Engine has become my primary game engine of choice.
                </p>
                <p> Crunch Time! Is available on Steam, Itch.io, GameJolt, and the Microsoft store.</p>
                <p> Also the first guy to ever review it was role-playing as a bird, to this day I have *no* idea how to process that...</p>
