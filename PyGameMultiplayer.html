            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>
                    Created as part of a university assignment, this project utilises Python, Pygame, and SQLite 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gameplay is very simple, the player must jump ontop of the other player to steal a point from them, as this project was meant more to explore networking and client/server relationships there is very minimal game design, lacking even the simplest win/fail conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players must login using existing valid credentials, with the program closing after a certain amount of failed attempts. Username and Passwords exist in an SQL database, with passwords being hashed with Python's Hashlib library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The database can be managed by a simple terminal script, with the option to create users from the testdata template, as well as adding and removing users manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to do this again, I would like to write cleaner, more robust code, as well as create some GUI for the Login and Database management systems. It also appears that the client/server code only works locally, which is an issue I did not fix during the initial assignment and would feel dishonest to repair now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -   Please Note: The code for this has been temporarily removed from my GitHub and will be returned shortly.
